What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- a .git directory is created to store all the metadata for version control usage
- I'm initializing a directory by typing "git init" in a chosen directory
- I need to do it because I want to give that directory all version control options
- It is suggested to use "git status" to see the status of your repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- Staging area is where you put your files before commiting them (and adding them to the repository)
- Working directory is the directory saved in your computer for git activity
- Repository is an up to date version control area where all the rules apply
- They are related as the staging area is a mid-place when moving a working directory to a repository
