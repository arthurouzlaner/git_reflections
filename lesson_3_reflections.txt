create new repository:
- git remote origin
- remote add origin https://github.com/arthurouzlaner/git_reflections.git
- git push origin master
- git remote -v

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when I have a release that is working and with no bugs
- when several people are working on the same project
- periodically so I'll have an access to my files from everywhere
